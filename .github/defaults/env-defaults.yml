# All of these are default env vars
# The images will be build with these env vars.
#
# The production containers will then be created from the images,
# at which point production secrets will be injected into the container
# to overwrite these defaults.
# (the production secrets will be stored as github action environment secrets (e.g. environment named "production", with three items-- one per set. 
#  and of course, ensure that those production secrets are brand new values for the relevant security-relevant items))
